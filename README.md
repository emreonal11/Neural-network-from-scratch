# Neural-network-from-scratch
Programmed a 2-layer neural network from scratch to classify MNIST images. The network uses the gradient of cross-entropy loss to train its weights. The training can be modified through the variation of hyperparameters controlling the size of the hidden layer, the type of activation function used and the learning rate for the gradient decent.
